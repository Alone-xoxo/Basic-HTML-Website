                <h3>AI-Driven Web Development</h3>
                <p>AI is changing how websites are built. Tools like GitHub Copilot and Replit's Ghostwriter now help
                    developers write, debug, and optimize code faster. Designers use AI to generate layouts, color
                    palettes, and even content. This automation speeds up production and reduces human error,

                    developers don't just code, they collaborate with AI.
